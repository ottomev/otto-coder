## Your Mission

Create professional, responsive design mockups based on the research completed in Stage 2. The client will need to **APPROVE** these designs before development begins.

## Research Reference

Review the research deliverables from Stage 2:
- `deliverables/02_research/market_analysis.md`
- `deliverables/02_research/competitor_analysis.md`
- `deliverables/02_research/audience_research.md`
- `deliverables/02_research/recommendations.md`

## Design Requirements

### Pages to Design
1. **Homepage** (most important!)
2. **About Page**
3. **Services/Products Page**
4. **Contact Page**
5. **Any other key pages identified in requirements**

### Design Elements
- **Color Scheme**: Create a cohesive color palette (primary, secondary, accent colors)
- **Typography**: Choose fonts for headings, body text, and UI elements
- **Layout**: Responsive grid system (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Components**: Buttons, forms, cards, navigation, footer
