# Frontend Deployment

This document explains the process of deploying frontend changes.

## Build Process

The frontend is a single-page application built with Vite. The web server serves the static files generated by the build process.

After making any changes to the frontend code in the `frontend/src` directory, you must rebuild the application to have those changes reflected in the deployed version.

To build the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm build
```

This command will create or update the `frontend/dist` directory with the latest version of the application.

## Caching

After deploying the new version, remember to clear your browser cache to ensure you are viewing the latest changes.

## Applying Styles

When making styling changes, it's important to understand how styles are applied in this project.

### Global Styles

Global style variables for colors, fonts, and border radius are defined in `frontend/src/styles/index.css`. You can modify the CSS variables in this file to change the overall look and feel of the application.

### Component Styles

However, changing the global style variables might not be enough. The components themselves need to use these styles. This is done through Tailwind CSS utility classes.

For example, to apply the border radius to the `Card` component, the `rounded-lg` class was added to the component's class list in `frontend/src/components/ui/card.tsx`.

If you change a style variable and don't see the change reflected in the application, you might need to find the relevant component and ensure it's using the correct Tailwind CSS class.
